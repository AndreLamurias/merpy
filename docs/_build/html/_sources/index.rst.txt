This software provides a Python interface with MER - Minimal Entity Recognition.
MER is a Named-Entity Recognition tool which given any lexicon and any
input text returns the list of terms recognized in the text, including
their exact location (annotations).

Given an ontology (owl file) MER is also able to link the entities to
their classes.
